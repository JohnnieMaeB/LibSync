**Introduction to the 2023 Guidelines**
In 2021, the Reference & User Services Association (RUSA) revised these guidelines to reflect changing aspects of reference work. Key changes include:
- Removal of the distinction between in-person and virtual reference, as virtual offerings have become more robust.
- Incorporation of equity, diversity, inclusion, and access (EDIA) principles, including a new section on Inclusion.
- Addition of an Evaluation section to address the culture of misinformation and disinformation.

**Preface**
These guidelines are for library workers who answer informational questions. The goal is user-centered service. Key principles include:
- Building relationships with users based on trust and intellectual empathy.
- Viewing reference interactions as collaborative learning experiences.
- Ascertaining the user's full information need before addressing it.
- Assisting users in developing their own information literacy skills.
- Diminishing the inherent power dynamic between library worker and user to create a co-created, meaningful interaction.

A welcoming and inclusive environment is crucial. The library worker:
1.1 Advocates for equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility.
1.2 Ensures service points are accessible.
1.3 Offers a variety of service modalities (including remote reference).
1.4 Engages with people on their own terms, without assumptions.
1.5 Reflects on their own implicit biases.

**2. Approachability**
First impressions set the tone. The library worker:
2.1 Is easily identifiable as a staff member.
2.2 Is visible and encourages interaction.
2.3 Acknowledges waiting users in a timely manner.
2.4 Gives their full attention to the user.
2.5 Requests help from colleagues if demand is heavy.
2.6 Avoids jargon and clarifies confusing terminology.

**3. Engagement**
The reference interview helps users explore and refine their questions. The library worker:
3.1 Encourages everyone to ask questions freely.
3.2 Focuses attention on the person.
3.3 Listens fully as the user states their need.
3.4 Uses open and closed questions to identify the information need.

3.7 Maintains communication to show interest.
3.8 Avoids expressing judgment.

**4. Searching**
An effective search is a collaborative process. The library worker:
4.1 Asks what search strategies the user has already tried.
4.2 Invites the user to contribute ideas throughout the process.
4.3 Uses open-ended questions to refine the search.
4.4 Offers the user the option to perform the search with guidance.

4.7 Checks if search results are meeting the user's needs.
4.8 Gets the user started and offers more assistance as needed.
4.9 Manages expectations about what can be accomplished in the user's timeframe.

**5. Evaluation**
Library workers help users evaluate information for trustworthiness. The library worker:
5.1 Assists the user in evaluating information for accuracy, authority, bias, credibility, currency, etc.
5.2 Identifies other evaluation techniques like lateral reading.
5.3 Works with the user to review results and find additional resources if needed.
5.4 Helps the user determine if results are in an appropriate language, format, or literacy level.

6.1 Confirms with the user that their need has been met.
6.2 Encourages the user to reach out again with future questions.
6.3 Refers the user to additional resources or subject specialists as needed.
6.4 Manages expectations based on library policies.
6.5 Explains when a question is beyond the library's scope and refers appropriately.
