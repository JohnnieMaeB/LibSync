We protect each library user's right to privacy and confidentiality regarding information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired, or transmitted.

We are committed to the public's right to know and to a broadly informed populace, which is essential for a democratic society. We provide information and resources that enable people to participate fully in their communities and government.

**Diversity**
We advocate for and support a wide range of perspectives and experiences. We build collections and create services that reflect the diversity of our communities and strive to create an inclusive and equitable environment for all.

**Education and Lifelong Learning**
We support the educational and lifelong learning goals of our communities. We provide resources and programs that encourage curiosity, critical thinking, and the pursuit of knowledge for all ages.

We uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist all efforts to censor library resources. We support the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction.

**Preservation**
We work to preserve our cultural and intellectual heritage by collecting, organizing, and protecting information in all its formats, ensuring it remains available for future generations.

**The Public Good**
